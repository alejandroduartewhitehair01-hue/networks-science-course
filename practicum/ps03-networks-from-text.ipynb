    "\n",
    "With the `networkx` [drawing](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/drawing.html) utilities, we can plot networks (as `matplotlib` Figures) and customize node and edge styles any way we like.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw with Cytoscape, the two basic elements of a network visualization are the **layout** and the element (node, edge) **styles**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic visualization function in `networkx` is [`nx.draw()`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.drawing.nx_pylab.draw.html), which has the following signature:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    nx.draw(g, pos=node_layout, **style_keywords)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Very briefly:\n",
    "* We specify the graph we want to draw as `g`.\n",
    "* The `pos` parameter takes as argument a dictionary mapping nodes in `g` to positions (coordinates in 2D space). \n",
    "    * There are [many functions](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/drawing.html#module-networkx.drawing.layout) in `networkx` for generating different layouts (i.e. node positions). Below we give an example using [`nx.spring_layout()`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.drawing.layout.spring_layout.html).\n",
    "* In `style_keywords` we pass the function a set of keyword arguments (either as a dictionary, or one-by-one) that affect the appearance of nodes, edges, and labels. \n",
    "    * For the basic set of parameters we can pass, and their formats, see the documentation entry of [`nx.draw_networkx()`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.drawing.nx_pylab.draw_networkx.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are basically two approaches for plotting with `networkx`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using the basic `nx.draw()` function, and passing the styles as arguments to that function; or\n",
    "* Using separate calls to `draw_networkx_nodes()`, `draw_networkx_edges()` and `draw_networkx_labels()` to draw the respective elements separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "The former approch is simpler, and is recommended at the beginning. The latter approach allows for a few more customizations and is more useful when dealing with large networks where the drawing may take a long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that under the hood `nx.draw()` uses the `draw_networkx_nodes()`, etc., functions, and it is those lower-level functions that define the names and permitted values of the styling parameters. You should check their documentation for reference.\n",
    "\n",
